# Dart Regex Test
Testing the performance of AOT compiled regular expressions in DART.

## Results:
- Same execution time as NodeJS
- Dart AOT and Dart JIT have the same execution time
- Dart AOT is more resource efficient (lower CPU / Memory)
- Dart AOT has an extremely small container size
- Dart AOT is still more resource intensive than NodeJS
